						<h1>Philipp Vidal</h1>
						<p>		
							Hi! My name is Philipp and I am a game developer from Bavaria in Germany. 
							My main focus lies in programming, specifically all things related to gameplay, but I often take on the role of generalist programmer. 
							I have been playing games for as long as I can remember, 
							and this passion for gaming has led me to pursue a career in the field. 
							Last year I graduated with a Master's Degree in <i>Game Engineering and Visual Computing</i> and I'm currently looking to break into the game industry as a programmer. 
							Outside of programming and creating games, my hobbies include movies, anime, manga and, of course, playing games with friends.

											<i><a href="https://enfusionengine.com/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">Enfusion Engine</a></i>.

											Having a solid educational background in game development, hands-on experience in game creation and modding,

											has allowed me to acquire a wide range of development skills outside of just programming,

											has not only allowed me to learn how to better implement others' feedback into my work

									<h2>Game Development</h2>
									<p>
										As a programmer, I bring more than just coding skills to the table. 
										With a solid educational background in game development and hands-on experience in game modding,
										I possess a wide range of development skills, which include creating game-ready assets, game design, 3D graphics, and animation.
									</p>
								</div>
								<div class="feature">
									<span class="icon solid alt major fas fa-code"></span>
									<h2>C# / C++</h2>
									<p>
										C++ and C# are the two programming languages I'm most familiar with. 
										The majority of programming-related university lectures made use of C++ as their main language, 
										while most bigger projects I've been part of utilized C#. 
										Both languages have also been used by me in private projects, 
										though these were usually smaller in scale.
									</p>
								</div>
								<div class="feature">
									<span class="icon solid alt major fas fa-desktop"></span>
									<h2>Game Engine knowledge</h2>
									<p>
										Throughout my academic career, I primarily utilized Unity, 
										which has provided me with a good understanding of its capabilities. 
										Additionally, I have also gained proficiency in Unreal Engine in my free time
										and obtained practical experience in the Enfusion Engine 
										thanks to the mods I've created for the game DayZ.
									</p>
								</div>
								<div class="feature">
									<span class="icon solid alt major featured fas fa-users"></span>
									<h2>Teamwork</h2>
									<p>
										During my studies at university, I participated in various group projects of different sizes,
										which allowed me to develop valuable teamwork skills. 
										Although I have not yet had the opportunity to work on larger projects with bigger teams, 
										my experience in these smaller projects has helped me enhance my skills in collaboration, communication, task delegation, and constructive feedback.

											Each detonator can be connected to multiple explosives at once, with the list of connected explosives being replicated efficiently over the network. 
											Similarly to my other DayZ mod "Breachingcharge", this mod also features a base raiding system that can be configured by the user.

											A mod that adds a fast travel system to DayZ that allows players to teleport between a set of predefined locations.
											DayZ is often described as a "walking simulator" due to the vast distances players have to travel to get to their destination 
											and it's not uncommon to go hours without seeing another player. 
											This mod aims to not only make it easier for a player to meet up with their friends, 
											but also to make remote areas more accessible, encouraging the exploration of otherwise underutilized locations.

										<h2>Avoiding Motion Sickness in VR</h2>
										<p>	
											As part of my master's thesis, I developed a virtual reality application that offers an

											of different locomotion methods and user interaction on the occurance of the malady within users.
